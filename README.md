# Action-Delete-Branch
This is for deleting a branch after closing the pull request without merging.
You just have to create a yml file in your .github/workflow/ folder also you have to add a label if you want to delete your branch after closing it or not like here I have added "Not Required" label, you can add your own. 
If you add the label only then it will delete the branch otherwise it won't.
